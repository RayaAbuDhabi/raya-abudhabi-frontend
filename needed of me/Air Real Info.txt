📝 Preferred Data Formats:
Best formats:

JSON/CSV files with coordinates
SVG/CAD files
Georeferenced images
Excel spreadsheet with data

Example JSON structure:
json{
  "gates": [
    {
      "id": "gate_a1",
      "name": "A1",
      "x": 1250.5,
      "y": 345.2,
      "concourse": "A",
      "type": "contact",
      "airlines": ["EY", "BA"]
    }
  ],
  "facilities": [...],
  "walkingPaths": [...]
}
🔄 What I'll Do Once You Provide Data:

✅ Update all gate positions to exact coordinates
✅ Scale the map to real dimensions
✅ Add all actual facilities with correct locations
✅ Calculate real walking distances
✅ Add accurate pathfinding routes
✅ Integrate any real-time data feeds
✅ Create a production-ready version

💾 Meanwhile, I'm Saving:
I'll keep the current demo structure ready so when you return with real data, I can:

Quickly swap out the mock data
Maintain all the features (zoom, pan, routing, etc.)
Keep the UI/UX intact

📞 Ready When You Are!
Just come back and say something like:

"I have the Terminal 3 data - here's the floor plan and gate list"

And I'll integrate it immediately! 🚀
Good luck getting the official data! 🎯
